    <title>Transparent Governance Model - 5 Dimension Matrix</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Satsanga = Good association</h1>
    <p>
        Sat = To Exist<br>
        Sanga = Group
    </p>
    <p>
        We are a group dedicated to answering a fundamental problem:
    </p>
    <p>
        How to create an open-source transparent governance model in a group with the minimum amount of agreements, where freedom of the individual is not suppressed by control and tyranny? Without running into the tyranny of the individual that we try to protect by the same agreement…
    </p>
    <p>
        As students of this subject, we manifest this initial proposal of a five-dimensional model Matrix as a DAO framework.
    </p>
    <p>
        For that, we stand that Vedic knowledge has already given the basis for this with the conception of the mahabhutas as the basis of all manifestation.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>The Five Mahabhutas (Elements):</strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>1. Ether</li>
        <li>2. Air</li>
        <li>3. Fire</li>
        <li>4. Water</li>
        <li>5. Earth</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        In the same way that this is the basis of Ayurvedic medicine, it should also be the base of anything under the sky, a way to see and act with 5 eyes…
    </p>
    <p>
        It is important to mention that this is not common sense knowledge, because it is completely different from all management theories up to this point and is based on 3 epistemological roots:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Reason</li>
        <li>Perception</li>
        <li>Trust</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        Out of these 3 ways, models of searching for understanding in the same level, truth, maybe, would be the meeting point and the sum of these mental conscious places, where they kind of emanate.
    </p>
    <p>
        But, if you have trust, how can it be that the one trusted will not be the Tyranny disguising itself in order to reign? The same idea that searches for decentralization of power, is condemned to be centralized in the end?
    </p>
    <p>
        This problem is not solved by these models that we are manifesting because it can only be solved by the roots that sustain the possibility of the model itself, which are:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Be surrounded by a group that believes in the same principles of life.</li>
        <li>Treasury freedom of the individual.</li>
        <li>Surrender to a contract that respects freedom.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        Number one will manifest around us according to the principles we follow.<br>
        Number two up to this point we, as humans, did not have the technology to guarantee, but there is a way manifested by someone a few years ago, a protocol that protects the individual treasury named BTC.<br>
        Number three is up to each individual to feel if; reason, nice feelings, and trust are there.
    </p>
    <p>
        So, we stand that this 5 model matrix can only be achieved with these roots, or else it will be only a new way of centralized domination.<br>
        It should be a second or third layer protocol based on a completely decentralized protocol named Bitcoin.<br>
        And it can be used by anyone who understands the above and is not only satisfied with freedom of money but also wants to be a part of a decentralized organization without blind allies.
    </p>
    <p>
        These protocols come with:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>5 Matrix view of the world</li>
        <li>Reverted Voting system</li>
        <li>5 elements Protocols</li>
    </ul>
    <p>

        3. From That, verily,—from This Self—is ākāśa (ether) born; from ākāśa, the air; from the air, fire; from fire, water; from water, earth; from earth, plants; from plants, food: from food, man.<br>
